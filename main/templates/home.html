        <h2>About KishanAi</h2>
        <p>
          KishanAi is an intelligent farming assistant built to help small and medium-scale farmers
          make faster, data-driven decisions. By combining lightweight computer-vision models,
          simple agricultural heuristics and practical recommendations, KishanAi brings modern
          precision-agriculture tools to everyday farming workflows — from early disease
          detection to livestock health checks and crop planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to reduce crop and livestock losses, save time for farmers, and increase
          productivity by providing clear, actionable guidance through a simple web interface.
          KishanAi focuses on accessibility, low-cost deployment (works with a standard webcam or smartphone),
          and clear explainability so farmers understand both the problem and the recommended remedy.

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Farmers often discover diseases too late — after significant leaf/fruit damage — because
                    visual symptoms can be subtle at first. Early-stage infections spread quickly and are
                    hard to diagnose without experience, leading to yield loss and unnecessary pesticide use.
                </p>

                <h3>Solution (what KishanAi provides)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automated image-based detection of common plant diseases using a lightweight CNN model.</li>
                    <li>Live camera stream with real-time overlay of predicted disease label so farmers can inspect plants continuously.</li>
                    <li>Actionable advice and next steps (e.g., isolation, organic remedies, when to consult an agronomist).</li>
                    <li>Periodic capture feature to save documented evidence for follow-up and tracking.</li>

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Livestock skin conditions (parasites, infections, wounds) are common and can rapidly
                    affect animal welfare and productivity. Small holders may miss early signs or apply
                    incorrect treatments, increasing risk and veterinary costs.
                </p>

                <h3>Solution (what KishanAi provides)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Image-based screening to identify common cow skin issues and categorize severity.</li>
                    <li>Confidence score with explanations so farmers know how certain the model is.</li>
                    <li>Practical advice (isolate animal, cleaning, topical treatment, consult veterinarian) tailored to the predicted condition.</li>

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Choosing the right crop for specific soil and climatic conditions can be difficult.
                    Poor crop selection reduces yields and income. Farmers lack simple, localized guidance
                    that factors in soil nutrients, pH, climate and rainfall patterns.

                <ul>
